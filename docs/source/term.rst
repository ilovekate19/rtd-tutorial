   * - TOSCA
     - **Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA)** represents a standard created by the industry group OASIS. OASIS is a nonprofit consortium that is engaged in the development of open standards supported by most vendors and major players in the cloud world as well as the telecom market. TOSCA (sometimes dubbed ‘TOSCA Cloud’) is known as one of the fastest growing standards in OASIS and has numerous use cases and implementations that have already been announced. The idea behind the TOSCA standard is to render improvements in the deployment, termination, and any other management function of cloud applications. By defining service templates consisting of different components and the relationships between these different parts, TOSCA helps configure applications and their underlying infrastructure as well as enable moving applications in the cloud in a very unique way. Also, all required orchestration policies and resources can be defined using templates dedicated for that purpose. The TOSCA standard has the main goal of answering the need for automation, portability, and interoperability along with the management challenges of complex cloud applications.
